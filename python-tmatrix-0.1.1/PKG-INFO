Description: A Python implementation of T-matrix codes by Michael I. Mishchenko, Larry D. Travis, and Daniel W. Mackowski (the used versions of the code employ DOUBLE PRECISION variables) for the following cases:  * The calculation of the amplitude and phase matrices for a particle with an axially    symmetric shape in fixed or randomly oriented positions. The calculations are    applicable to spheroids, finite circular cylinders, Chebyshev particles, and    generalized Chebyshev particles (distorted water drops).  * The calculation of light scattering by randomly oriented two-sphere clusters with    touching or separated components.  * The calculation of the efficiency factors and scattering matrix for an ensemble of    spheres in fixed or randomly oriented positions.
